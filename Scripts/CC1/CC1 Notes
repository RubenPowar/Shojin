Description:

This script is designed to auto-generate a CC1 from an appraisal.
It processes an appraisal produced by someone on the Lending team.
The inputs are included in an excel file produced by the person appraising the proposal.
There should be a standardised set of sheets, which are linked to the bespoke appraisals for each person.
    Coversheet:
        This pulls data from the appraisal model. This is core data for the appraisal.
        This data should eventually be entered into a database of appraisals. database should link metrics
    Tables Sheet:
        This will contain all other tables that are required for the CC1.
        It will be comprised of multiple labelled tables to be copied into CC1
        e.g. Accommodation schedule, Track Record, Appraisal, Indicative Terms, Cashflow, etc.




Explanation:

The script PopulateCC1.py is called, requiring the filepath of the appraisal and supporting doc destination
(main) It opens a template (in future to be dependent on type of appraisal)
(get_context) the context is produced, extracted from coversheet, the Tables sheet, using InsertTable.py
Static maps are generated using GetMaps.py, and amenities text is produces using GetMapInfo.py
The resulting context is returned to (output_to_file) which then populates the loaded template, and saves
do the original filepath.

Future Modifications:




The CC1 Generation scripts are broken down as follows:
    Main body = PopulateCC1.py
